# Pygame_game
This is my first full game in pygame i hope you enjoy. If you find a bug or you would like me to add anything just ask.


To run, make sure pygame is installed if so go to the python script called BlockDodge.py then open it and run the code.

you will need python 3.11 at least and you will need to install pygame, to do that you will go to your terminal and type in 
"pip install pygame "
